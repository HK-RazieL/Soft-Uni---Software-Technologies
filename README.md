01. HTML and CSS exercises - 28.02.2017
  Very entertaining to learn new technologies and I like the idea of making online applications overal.

02. Custom Blog Exercise - 02.03.2017
  At this point we are starting to learn how to make different files to work together and make connections between 
them in an onlin environment.

03. PHP Syntax, Basic Web - 06.03.2017
  I am not a big fan of PHP, I don't really know what it is about it that puts me off, but i don't think this is 
going to be for me.

04. Calculator - 13.03.2017
  Working more with PHP just makes me want to do something else instead of my homework...

05. Blog - 15.03.2017
  I understand that this is meant just to make us familiar with the technology but throwing us in the middle of a 
project like that doesn't really teach us much for the time that we are given.

06. JS Basics Exercises - 21.03.2017
  Going to JavaScript I have mainly heard bad things about the language although in SoftUni everyone seems to love it for some reason, I find it rather enjoyable especially compared to PHP.

07. JS Calculator - 22.03.2017
  Now this is something else!  The calculator exercise that we have to do with the 4 languages 
was a lot simpler it seems than it was with PHP. Although this might have been due to me already 
being familiar with the project and what we are supposed to do i still found it a lot more enjoyable 
with JavaScript!
